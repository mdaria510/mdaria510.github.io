            <p>I believe the ability to learn and adapt quickly is the single most important trait a developer can bring to the table. Anyone can learn how to code – <em>but few can demonstrate a consistent ability to adapt to today’s ever changing landscape.</em> </p>
            <p>It begins with a lifelong and genuine passion for programming and computing. Long before I received the Computer Information Systems and other Bachelor’s degrees, I have used practical computing and programming skills to set myself apart. My professional experience dates back to an internship at Citibank in 2003, programming for mainframes in complex, very user-unfriendly languages such as REXX. Before it was commonplace, I programmed bots to search for underpriced items in online classified ads, and made a successful business out of it for years. Most recently, programming has become an invaluable way to set myself apart from my colleagues and become indispensable in both scientific and medical laboratories. </p>
            <p>Equally important is the ability to work effectively with a team, particularly in demanding roles that require responsibility and accountability. My work as a Cytotechnologist (a high level clinical laboratory professional) requires continuous collaboration with physicians at every level. Reaching an accurate diagnosis is quite literally a matter of life and death, and I have professionally fulfilled my role within this very demanding profession for over 8 years. </p>
            <p>And finally, a thirst for challenge and the initiative to act upon it. Outside of professional development, few recognize the possibilities that a skilled programmer can bring to the table. Facing a difficult to use laboratory system, I took it upon myself to automate significant portions of the workflow, saving thousands of hours of wasted productivity and reducing the administrative nightmare of life-threatening medical errors. One does not need to the title of developer to solve real world problems with programming, as long as one is able to recognize solvable problems, design unique solutions, and use whatever tool is best suited to the job, learning on the fly. Wherever I can identify a pain point, I will always figure out a way to implement a solution to alleviate it.</p>
            <p>Having reached the pinnacle of my current profession, I am now ready to fully devote my time and energy to software development, and I’m currently seeking the right match to begin my journey. I am interested in all types of software development – web, mobile, desktop and backend. If your organization is looking for a fast learning junior developer with maturity, a proven work ethic and over a decade practical professional experience, please do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>
